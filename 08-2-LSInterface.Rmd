# Annex II Basics of LimeSurvey Interface {-}

## Basic structure of the interface {-}

For a quick start regarding the LimeSurvey platform and GEAM Questionnaire, you can watch the video [GEAM First Steps](https://vimeo.com/422763740)

Global features of the questionnaire such as its title or welcome message are controlled via “Settings” while individual question content can be edited via the “Structure” panel. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="100%", fig.caption="Global Survey Settings." }
knitr::include_graphics(path="images/survey-settings.png")
```

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Individual questions can be edited under the "Structure" view: 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="100%", fig.caption="Structure Settings." }
knitr::include_graphics(path="images/structure-section-lock.png")
```


Note the "locked" symbole in the illustration above. Changing the order of questions or question groups requires to "unlock" the left column. 

## "Question Editor" versus "Question Overview" {-}

When clicking a specific question in the left "Structure" column, it becomes editable in the main view. By default, the "Question Editor" View becomes active to change question text or answer options. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="100%", fig.caption="Question Editor" }
knitr::include_graphics(path="images/question-editor.png")
```

In contrast, the "Question Overiew" provides access to the setting conditional logics, default answer, export options or for deleting the question. Note the change in the top button rows in the Illustration below. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="100%", fig.caption="Question Editor" }
knitr::include_graphics(path="images/question-overview.png")
```
