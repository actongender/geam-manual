# Annex II Basics of LimeSurvey Interface {-}

## Basic structure of the interface

For a quick start regarding the LimeSurvey platform and GEAM Questionnaire, you can watch the video [GEAM First Steps](https://geam.act-on-gender.eu/content/documentation)

Global features of the questionnaire such as its title or welcome message are controlled via “Settings” while individual question content can be edited via the “Structure” panel. 



## LimeSurvey Text Editor {#ls-editor}
LimeSurvey has a build-in text editor. By default, question texts or the data policy text is shown in “plain text mode” which might be confusing since it contains HTML formatting tags such as “\<p\>”, “\<strong\>.. \<\/strong\>”. 

By clicking on the lateral pencil-icon, a rich-text editor opens in a new window in order to edit any text without worrying about its formatting.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="100%", fig.caption="Opening the LimeSurvey rich-text editor." }
knitr::include_graphics(path="images/TextEditor.png")
```


When saving the edited content, it is important to save first the contexts of the rich-text editor by clicking on the small save/disk-icon inside the small window, close the editor-window and then save the contexts of the item with the “save” button of the main window.
