# Data protection and privacy issues

Protecting privacy and confidentiality of survey respondents is a key concern and has to be considered carefully before preparing and launching a survey. This involves a clear understanding of the concepts involved and to clarify the legal and organizational requirements for you survey. It also involves following certain standards for data management, storage and data reuse.

## About privacy and confidentiality

Although "privacy" and "confidentiality" are often used interchangeably the concepts should be distinguished [@EuropeanCommission2010].

**Privacy** is a more fundamental concept and entails the a) control of information about oneself, b) control over access to oneself (both physical and mental), c) control over one's ability to make important life decisions.

**Confidentiality** on the other hand is a more limited concept and concerns first and foremost the protection of personal information. "Confidentiality is a duty that arises when someone has been granted access to information that would otherwise be kept secret" [@EuropeanCommission2010, p. 79ff].

Most importantly, privacy considerations limit the ways in which we acquire information, whereas confidentiality considerations deal with the protection of this acquired information.

```{block, type="noteHighlight"}
In concrete terms, the distinction between “privacy” and “confidentiality” implies to specify how privacy is protected during data collection, including the decisions to (not) participate, and how the collected data will be handled in a confidential manner after it has been recorded.
```

For the GEAM survey, privacy implies to give respondents relative control over data entry ("what" and "when"), including the possibility to opt out and delete their data at any moment during the submission process. Confidentiality implies that result data is anonymized and stored in a secure way to prevent unauthorized access.

## Collecting Personal (Sensitive) Data

The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR Regulation 2016/679) draws a distinction between "personal data" and "personal sensitive data".

**Personal data** means "any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person" (article 4.1).

**Sensitive personal data** or special categories of personal data refers to information revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation (article 9).

The GEAM includes items inquiring about Sensitive Personal Information (e.g.: sexual orientation, health impairments or reporting discrimination associated with ethnicity) because these variables also constitute the main dimensions of social discrimination [@BaumannErhebungAntidiskriminierungsdatenreprasentativen2018]. From our perspective, it is important to address these sensitive issues in the GEAM because otherwise important discriminatory practices will remain invisible and cannot be addressed by adequate Gender Equality measures.

```{block, type="noteHighlight"}
The FUOC is responsible for providing a technical secure solution to conduct online GEAM surveys. However, the survey content and handling of result data will be the responsibility of the survey administrator.
```

In the last instance it is the survey administrator who has to decide the adequate security settings for a specific survey instance taking into account the GEAM content, national legislation and organizational information needs and context(s).

Questions and response options may need to be adapted according to an **organization's or country's legal requirements** where it affects monitoring practices, policies and the terms used to describe populations. Survey administrators, when editing questions and response options on protected characteristics, need to be aware of the rights and permissions in their country. For instance, they **need to know if permissions to collect data on protected characteristics such as sex, race and sexual orientation** differ or require an organization to re-phrase the language in the survey to be in line with regulatory standards.

When editing questions or response options for regulatory reasons, it is recommended that you use tried and tested, nationally accepted replacements (for example, the response options presented in a national census). This will increase the likelihood that other organizations in the same country have used similar questions and response options, producing a standardized approach and enabling organizations to benchmark themselves nationally.

In order to make informed decisions regarding privacy protection and confidential treatment of result data, please make sure to read this document carefully, especially the section on [Controlling data privacy and response tracking](#launch-control-privacy). You will also be required to sign the [Annex III - Declaration of Data Protection and Confidentiality Agreement](#annex-iii-declaration-of-data-protection) for survey administrators before you can launch a survey (you can still edit and prepare your questionnaire without having signed the agreement with the FUOC. However, before collecting data, you will need to provide a signed copy).

## Data Storage

Once a survey has finished and the result data matrix has been downloaded from the LimeSurvey platform, we recommend the following easy steps to protect the confidentiality of the responses and prevent unauthorized access to your data.

### Anonymization

The GEAM does **not contain** questions regarding direct personal identifiers such as social security number, names, email addresses or similar. Thus, the collected data is anonymous on a very basic level. LimeSurvey does not store any personal information with the survey results either. However, respondents might provide certain identifiers in open text questions such as organizational names or names of colleagues which unintentionally can identify their (and others) contributions.

```{block, type="noteHighlight"}
Please check the open text fields in your result data for any plain names and other possible identifiers submitted by respondents. Before further processing your results. We recommend replacing these instances with custom codes or XXX-ing them out.
```

### Encrypting result data

A relatively easy but seldom applied measure to protect your data is to save the corresponding file(s) with a password. This works mainly when the results are downloaded as a Microsoft Excel file.

```{block, type="noteHighlight"}
Before sharing the result data with the inner circle of colleagues, please password protect the file. Do not send the password together with the file (in the same email!).   
```

More sophisticated options are available such as using digital signatures and GPG encryption. GPG encryption is easily available on Linux operation systems. For Windows, see <https://www.gpg4win.org/>. The advantage of using advanced encryption techniques consists of protecting your data with a personal signature/password without limitations to share data with others. The architecture of public and private encryption keys enables you to encrypt data with a specific addressee in mind -- and which then can be only decrypted by that particular person. This basically enables you to share protected data without having to worry about circulating a single password (used for encryption) among collaborators.

### Deletion

Note that when deleting data from a computer, the file is not actually erased but moved to a trash-bin and can be easily recuperated. This is especially important when working on a shared computer. When you download the result dataset, make sure others (including administrators) cannot access it at a later point in time.

Data should be stored on your personal (Desktop) account (protected by your password). If you store it on an external (flash) drive, be sure to save it password protected in order to prevent unauthorized access in case of loss. Even better: encrypt your external (flash) drive; in case of loss, your data is still protected!

## Disclosure Control

Whereas "anonymization" can remove or replace identifiers from a dataset and thus prevent the identification of respondents, "quasi-identifiers" pose a different challenge. Quasi-identifiers refer to the variables used in the study and whose combination can lead to the re-identification of the respondent. For example, @GolleRevisitingUniquenessSimple2006 and @sweeney2000uniqueness show that 63% (or 87% respectively for older data) of the US population can be unambiguously identified by combining a 5-digit ZIP code, birth date and sex! The problem is that quasi-identifiers cannot be removed from the result data because they are required to perform useful analysis of the data.

In case you plan to distribute your result dataset beyond the inner circle of persons involved with the collection and analysis of the GEAM, you need to carefully think about your quasi-identifiers. To prevent disclosure control, quasi-identifiers need to be examined in relation to the number of respondents in your data. A combination of professional category, age and gender might be enough to identify a person in a small research institute but insufficient in a dataset of several hundred or thousands of respondents.

## Sharing Data

Given the potential disclosure control issues, the ACT project does not publish any result data tables of GEAM questionnaires.

```{block, type="noteWarning"}
Survey administrators are advised at this point to only publish survey results in aggregated format.
