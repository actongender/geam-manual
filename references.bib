  abstract = {According to a famous study [10] of the 1990 census data, 87\% of the US population can be uniquely identified by gender, ZIP code and full date of birth. This short paper revisits the uniqueness of simple demographics in the US population based on the most recent census data (the 2000 census). We offer a detailed, comprehensive and up-to-date picture of the threat to privacy posed by the disclosure of simple demographic information. Our results generally agree with the findings of [10], although we find that disclosing one's gender, ZIP code and full date of birth allows for unique identification of fewer individuals (63\% of the US population) than reported in [10]. We hope that our study will be a useful reference for privacy researchers who need simple estimates of the comparative threat of disclosing various demographic data.},

  abstract = {Now in its third edition, this market-leading textbook continues to provide students with an excellent explanation and demonstration of the main approaches and techniques in social research methods. The book shows students how to assess the contexts within which different research methods may be used, and how they should be implemented. It covers both quantitative and qualitative research and examines the significance of this very distinction. It also covers mixed methods research, a topic on which the author is an authority. In an accessible and student-friendly manner, the book shows students how to go about doing their own research projects and how to write up their research. In addition to presenting a wide range of features within the text, including up-to-date empirical research examples, the third edition supports students and lecturers with a full set of online resources. Online Resource Centre For lecturers resources include PowerPoint slides, notes to accompany the slides, case studies with questions, and a test bank to enable lecturers to create their own unique online testing sessions.For students the resources include instant feedback multiple choice questions, web links, an online research guide, interactive Excel tutorials, and access to the real-life student experiences used in the book},
