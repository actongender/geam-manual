# Analysing Results 

The GEAM Core collects both quantitative and qualitative information (in the form of open text boxes). We sketch the basic approaches to analyzing both types of data. 

As part of the overall GEAM tool, ACT provides a template for **generating automatically** an overview of descriptive results of your survey data. The template is based on R and Rmarkdown and hosted on the projects [Github](https://github.com/actongender/geam-report). 

If your survey is based upon the GEAM Core questions, using the template script eases the task of examining your data considerably. For each question, the script will **generate frequency tables** as well as corresponding **graphics on the fly**. It also provides an overview of missing answers/cases. 

```{block, type="noteHighlight"}
Note, that the template report/script does not cover any additional questions that you may have added. 
```

In order to use the script, you need to be familiar with R and Rstudio. In case you are not familiar with R, you can contact either FUOC or AdvanceHE and we will generate the report for you. You need to export the R syntax file and R data file exactly as indicated in the previous [section](#export-to-R). 


## Analyzing Quantitative Data

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  echo = FALSE, 
  message = FALSE, 
  warning = FALSE,
  comment = "#>"
)


library(tidyverse)
library(sjPlot)
library(sjmisc)
library(sjlabelled)
library(RColorBrewer)

source("util/util.fn.R")

load("data/survey_477463_df.rdata")

pal2 <-  brewer.pal(2, "Set1")
pal3 <-  brewer.pal(3, "Set1")
pal4 <-  brewer.pal(4, "Set1")
pal5 <-  brewer.pal(5, "Set1")
pal6 <-  brewer.pal(6, "Set1")
pal7 <-  brewer.pal(7, "Set1")

hideNA = T

```

Quantitative data is numerical information such as age, years’ experience, numbers of items, salary and scale scores. 
Mixed quantitative data can be analyzed using a variety of statistical techniques including as descriptive statistics, crosstab analysis, t-tests, chi-square tests, correlations, ANOVA, and logistic regressions. 

A word of caution regarding some statistical concepts. 

- **Correlation**. Simply means that two variables correlate to a certain degree. For example we observe that the number of deaths by drowning coincide with the number of people eating ice cream. 

- **Causation.** From the previous example it should be clear that correlation is not causation. Although we can observe that higher numbers of people eating ice cream tend to coincide with higher numbers of drowning, the first does not cause the latter. Causation requires a detailed explanation of why things happen. In the context of the GEAM data and analysis, we can never talk that X causes Y and all references to “causation” should be avoided. To understand the criteria when “causation” is indicated consult [@HillEnvironmentDiseaseAssociation1965]. 

- **Statistically significant** relationship. A statistically significant relationship indicates that you have sufficient evidence to conclude that the relationship you observe in the sample (e.g. all survey respondents in your organization) also exists in the population (e.g. all employees of your organization). 


### Descriptive Statistics

On a very basic level, many question items in the GEAM Core can be summarized with descriptive statistics, including a table of frequencies of responses, some graphics and measures of location and dispersion. In the following we present different examples, one for each type fo variable. Here is the example output for three variables, gender, age, and highest qualification. Note that the data has been generate randomly. 

**Gender**:

```{r gender, eval=!is.null(data$SDEM004), fig.align='center', fig.width=6}

data %>% 
    filter(!is.na(SDEM004) & hideNA) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x=SDEM004, fill=SDEM004)) + 
    geom_bar(width=.5) +
    scale_fill_manual(values=pal2) +
    labs(y="Total count") +
    guides(fill=F) +
    theme_light() +
    theme(axis.title.x = element_blank())
```

<p>&nbsp;</p>

```{r gender_tab, eval=!is.null(data$SDEM004)}

print_frqtable(data$SDEM004)
```
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

**Age**

```{r year_born, eval=!is.null(data$SDEM001)}
#simulate some data 
df.age <- data.frame(age=sample(c(1955:2005), 300, replace=T))

ggplot(df.age,aes(x=age)) + 
    geom_bar()+ 
    labs(title="") +
    theme_light() +
    theme(axis.title.x = element_blank())

```

**Highest Qualification** (Categorical)

```{r high_qual, eval=!is.null(data$SDEM016), fig.width=10, fig.height=5}

data %>% 
    filter(!is.na(SDEM016) & hideNA) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x=SDEM016, fill=SDEM016)) + 
    geom_bar(width=.5) + 
    coord_flip() +
    labs(y="Total count") +
    guides(fill=F) + 
    theme_light() +
    theme(axis.title.y=element_blank())
```

```{r high_qual_tab, eval=!is.null(data$SDEM016)}

print_frqtable(data$SDEM016)
```
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


**Job Satisfaction** (Likert Scale)

```{r eval=!is.null(data$EWCS89JobSatisfact8_SQ001), fig.height=8, fig.width=10}
data %>%
  select(starts_with("EWCS89JobSatisfact8_SQ0")) %>%
  plot_likert(geom.colors=pal6, values="show", show.prc.sign=T, catcount = 4, cat.neutral = 3) + 
  theme_light()

```


Graphics and frequency tables will be generated automatically by the [GEAM Reporting Template](https://github.com/actongender/geam-report).

## Analyzing Qualitative Data
Qualitative data is non-numerical information such as written responses, recorded speech, observations, audio, images and so on. Qualitative data in surveys is produced from written responses that can be collated, ordered and analyzed for patterns (codes and themes), meaning and frequency. Qualitative data requires textual analysis and can produce rich information. Dedicated software packages for qualitative analysis are available such as [Nvivo](https://www.qsrinternational.com/nvivo/home) or [Atlas.ti](https://atlasti.com). 

See the example below for guidance on how qualitative responses are analyzed.

Question: (BISB005) "If there is more that you would like to say regarding your experience(s) of bullying and harassment in your department, faculty or organization, please do so here."

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="100%", fig.caption="Example text for qualitative analysis" }
knitr::include_graphics(path="images/Qual_ThematicAnalysis.png")
```

Analysis:

1. The first step of the process is to collate all written responses of questions by copy/pasting them onto a Microsoft Word document or exporting them to a qualitative software package such as NVivo or Atlas.ti. 
2. Incoherent responses can be removed so they are not analyzed or ignored.
3. The remaining ‘useable’ responses can be matched to an identification code/ reference number of a respondent so that all their responses can be tracked.
4. Preliminary analysis involves reading responses for understanding and by highlighting the key parts as shown in the peach boxes above.
5. Secondary analysis involves ordering the highlighted parts into ‘codes’ and grouping them into ‘themes’ as seen in the green and peach boxes above. ‘Bullying’ is the theme – the topic of the quote. ‘Examples’, ‘staff reactions’, ‘bullied’ are the primary codes – the sub topics of bullying. The various examples of bullying, for instance, are secondary codes, which can later be counted and indicate how bullying is conducted in each faculty or department, what the most frequent type of bullying is, and even who is most likely to bully or be the victim of bullying based on the data provided. 
6. A third review of the data, the codes and the themes produced during analysis helps tidy the findings by reducing data duplication and addressing omissions. A second analyst should be consulted at this stage to verify that the codes and themes generated are reliable and accurate.
7. Once the analysis of all written responses is complete and codes and themes have been verified, thematic tables can be produced to present key findings (see table below).
8. The underlined/ highlighted written responses from survey respondents are examples of quotes that researchers might use in in reports, after personal information has been removed.



| Code                         | Frequency|
|------------------------------|----------|
| Bullying: of male staff from students | 11 |
| Bullying: of supporting female staff: from students | 10 |
| Bullying: examples: ridicule, undermine, under value work: from staff | 9 |
| Bullying: of staff male researchers: from male staff | 8 | 
| Bullying: of female academic staff: from male students | 6 | 
| Bullying: examples: interrupting, silencing: from staff | 6 | 
| Bullying: of staff team lead: from staff | 3 | 

The frequency of codes can indicate issues that are most prevalent and can highlight areas to focus on when reporting the results of the survey. Key thematic findings can also be presented as a graph, helping to demonstrate key issues and findings.
